## Important Points
- The chosen topology: > Flyback converter
- Optimization for loss, size and price is highly needed for design process. GUI has been constructed to understand relations between parameters. GUI will be used as tool to define some constraints, requirements and relation for optimization. 
## Plans

  <markdown>
   - Flyback converter controllers have been researching
    - LT8316 has been selected as controller.
    - Controllers have low input voltage limits can be biased with some LDO application with BJT or Mosfet, which results in increase in alternatives of controller.
    - PowiGan controller from Power Integration is kept as option due to advantages of PowiGan in terms efficiency(No opto, Synchronous drive, GaNFET) and compactness. If the controlle for PowiGan can be succeeded, it can be used.
